# ChPTdiagram
Program for the specification and evaluation of diagrams in chiral perturbation theory (ChPT).

The Python program ChPTdiagram.py generates FORM code that can then be further customized using the procedures loaded under ChPTdiagram.hf.
Run 
```
$ python3 ChPTdiagram.py help
```
for further instructions, and inspect the generated code for guidance on how to use the FORM library.

Requires python 3, FORM (https://www.nikhef.nl/~form/) and my Python library for permutations (https://github.com/mssjo/permute/).
